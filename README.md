Main things i learned:
1) Store functions return values in a variable.
2) using a function in an if statement
3) understanding of why sets can be helpful
4) Different approaches -> win_condition for example, i spent 3h, trying numerous ways to find a valid-ish sollution.
5) Debugging. I've debugged so many times, ive learned ways to test it, such as printing each thing so i can see whats happening. As well as using python tutor visualizer
6) learned more about the enumerate function. I thought you could only use it in loops, but turns out that is merely not the case. IT adds a counter to your list,etc.
7) the biggest thing i've learned is pateince. I used to get frustrated and disapointed in my ability to code. A lot of it had to do with my personal problems. 
and nothing to do with the code itself. All i needed was a bit of patience and determination, brute will power, etc. I feel like i've learned a new part of me through this project.
